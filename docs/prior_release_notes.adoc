This section reproduces the release notes for new features and incompatible
changes in prior releases of Apache Kudu.


NOTE: The list of known issues and limitations for prior releases are not
reproduced on this page. Please consult the
link:http://kudu.apache.org/releases/[documentation of the appropriate release]
for a list of known issues and limitations.


[[rn_1.2.0]]
== Release notes specific to 1.2.0

[[rn_1.2.0_new_features]]
== New features

* Kudu clients and servers now redact user data such as cell values
  from log messages, Java exception messages, and `Status` strings.
  User metadata such as table names, column names, and partition
  bounds are not redacted.
+
Redaction is enabled by default, but may be disabled by setting the new
`log_redact_user_data` flag to `false`.

* Kudu's ability to provide consistency guarantees has been substantially
improved:

** Replicas now correctly track their "safe timestamp". This timestamp
   is the maximum timestamp at which reads are guaranteed to be
   repeatable.

** A scan created using the `SCAN_AT_SNAPSHOT` mode will now
   either wait for the requested snapshot to be "safe" at the replica
   being scanned, or be re-routed to a replica where the requested
   snapshot is "safe". This ensures that all such scans are repeatable.

** Kudu Tablet Servers now properly retain historical data when a row
   with a given primary key is inserted and deleted, followed by the
   insertion of a new row with the same key. Previous versions of Kudu
   would not retain history in such situations. This allows the server
   to return correct results for snapshot scans with a timestamp in the
   past, even in the presence of such "reinsertion" scenarios.

** The Kudu clients now automatically retain the timestamp of their latest
   successful read or write operation. Scans using the `READ_AT_SNAPSHOT` mode
   without a client-provided timestamp automatically assign a timestamp
   higher than the timestamp of their most recent write. Writes also propagate
   the timestamp, ensuring that sequences of operations with causal dependencies
   between them are assigned increasing timestamps. Together, these changes
   allow clients to achieve read-your-writes consistency, and also ensure
   that snapshot scans performed by other clients return causally-consistent
   results.

* Kudu servers now automatically limit the number of log files.
  The number of log files retained can be configured using the
  `max_log_files` flag. By default, 10 log files will be retained
  at each severity level.

== Optimizations and improvements

* The logging in the Java and {cpp} clients has been substantially quieted.
  Clients no longer log messages in normal operation unless there
  is some kind of error.

* The {cpp} client now includes a `KuduSession::SetErrorBufferSpace`
  API which can limit the amount of memory used to buffer
  errors from asynchronous operations.

* The Java client now fetches tablet locations from the Kudu Master
  in batches of 1000, increased from batches of 10 in prior versions.
  This can substantially improve the performance of Spark and Impala
  queries running against Kudu tables with large numbers of tablets.

* Table metadata lock contention in the Kudu Master was substantially
  reduced. This improves the performance of tablet location lookups on
  large clusters with a high degree of concurrency.

* Lock contention in the Kudu Tablet Server during high-concurrency
  write workloads was also reduced. This can reduce CPU consumption and
  improve performance when a large number of concurrent clients are writing
  to a smaller number of a servers.

* Lock contention when writing log messages has been substantially reduced.
  This source of contention could cause high tail latencies on requests,
  and when under high load could contribute to cluster instability
  such as election storms and request timeouts.

* The `BITSHUFFLE` column encoding has been optimized to use the `AVX2`
  instruction set present on processors including Intel(R) Sandy Bridge
  and later. Scans on `BITSHUFFLE`-encoded columns are now up to 30% faster.

* The `kudu` tool now accepts hyphens as an alternative to underscores
  when specifying actions. For example, `kudu local-replica copy-from-remote`
  may be used as an alternative to `kudu local_replica copy_from_remote`.

[[rn_1.2.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1508[KUDU-1508]
  Fixed a long-standing issue in which running Kudu on `ext4` file systems
  could cause file system corruption.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1399[KUDU-1399]
  Implemented an LRU cache for open files, which prevents running out of
  file descriptors on long-lived Kudu clusters. By default, Kudu will
  limit its file descriptor usage to half of its configured `ulimit`.

* link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/5192[Gerrit #5192]
  Fixed an issue which caused data corruption and crashes in the case that
  a table had a non-composite (single-column) primary key, and that column
  was specified to use `DICT_ENCODING` or `BITSHUFFLE` encodings. If a
  table with an affected schema was written in previous versions of Kudu,
  the corruption will not be automatically repaired; users are encouraged
  to re-insert such tables after upgrading to Kudu 1.2 or later.

* link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/5541[Gerrit #5541]
  Fixed a bug in the Spark `KuduRDD` implementation which could cause
  rows in the result set to be silently skipped in some cases.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1551[KUDU-1551]
  Fixed an issue in which the tablet server would crash on restart in the
  case that it had previously crashed during the process of allocating
  a new WAL segment.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1764[KUDU-1764]
  Fixed an issue where Kudu servers would leak approximately 16-32MB of disk
  space for every 10GB of data written to disk. After upgrading to Kudu
  1.2 or later, any disk space leaked in previous versions will be
  automatically recovered on startup.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1750[KUDU-1750]
  Fixed an issue where the API to drop a range partition would drop any
  partition with a matching lower _or_ upper bound, rather than any partition
  with matching lower _and_ upper bound.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1766[KUDU-1766]
  Fixed an issue in the Java client where equality predicates which compared
  an integer column to its maximum possible value (e.g. `Integer.MAX_VALUE`)
  would return incorrect results.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1780[KUDU-1780]
  Fixed the `kudu-client` Java artifact to properly shade classes in the
  `com.google.thirdparty` namespace. The lack of proper shading in prior
  releases could cause conflicts with certain versions of Google Guava.

* link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/5327[Gerrit #5327]
  Fixed shading issues in the `kudu-flume-sink` Java artifact. The sink
  now expects that Hadoop dependencies are provided by Flume, and properly
  shades the Kudu client's dependencies.

* Fixed a few issues using the Python client library from Python 3.


[[rn_1.2.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.2.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.2 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0. If the client uses features
  that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.2 without limitations.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.1 and Kudu 1.2 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.

[[rn_1.2.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.2.0

* The replication factor of tables is now limited to a maximum of 7. In addition,
  it is no longer allowed to create a table with an even replication factor.

* The `GROUP_VARINT` encoding is now deprecated. Kudu servers have never supported
  this encoding, and now the client-side constant has been deprecated to match the
  server's capabilities.

=== New Restrictions on Data, Schemas, and Identifiers

Kudu 1.2.0 introduces several new restrictions on schemas, cell size, and identifiers:

Number of Columns:: By default, Kudu will not permit the creation of tables with
more than 300 columns. We recommend schema designs that use fewer columns for best
performance.

Size of Cells:: No individual cell may be larger than 64KB. The cells making up a
a composite key are limited to a total of 16KB after the internal composite-key encoding
done by Kudu. Inserting rows not conforming to these limitations will result in errors
being returned to the client.

Valid Identifiers:: Identifiers such as column and table names are now restricted to
be valid UTF-8 strings. Additionally, a maximum length of 256 characters is enforced.

[[rn_1.2.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.2 Java client is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.1. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.1 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.2 client and
  vice-versa.

* The Kudu 1.2 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.1.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.1 client will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.2 client. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.2 client will run without modification against the Kudu 1.1
  client unless they use one of the following new APIs:
** `kudu::DisableSaslInitialization()`
** `KuduSession::SetErrorBufferSpace(...)`

* The Kudu 1.2 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.1. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.1 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.2 client
  and vice-versa.


[[rn_1.1.0]]
== Release notes specific to 1.1.0

[[rn_1.1.0_new_features]]
== New features

* The Python client has been brought up to feature parity with the Java and {cpp} clients
  and as such the package version will be brought to 1.1 with this release (from 0.3). A
  list of the highlights can be found below.
    ** Improved Partial Row semantics
    ** Range partition support
    ** Scan Token API
    ** Enhanced predicate support
    ** Support for all Kudu data types (including a mapping of Python's `datetime.datetime` to
    `UNIXTIME_MICROS`)
    ** Alter table support
    ** Enabled Read at Snapshot for Scanners
    ** Enabled Scanner Replica Selection
    ** A few bug fixes for Python 3 in addition to various other improvements.

* IN LIST predicate pushdown support was added to allow optimized execution of filters which
  match on a set of column values. Support for Spark, Map Reduce and Impala queries utilizing
  IN LIST pushdown is not yet complete.

* The Java client now features client-side request tracing in order to help troubleshoot timeouts.
  Error messages are now augmented with traces that show which servers were contacted before the
  timeout occurred instead of just the last error. The traces also contain RPCs that were
  required to fulfill the client's request, such as contacting the master to discover a tablet's
  location. Note that the traces are not available for successful requests and are not
  programmatically queryable.

== Optimizations and improvements

* Kudu now publishes JAR files for Spark 2.0 compiled with Scala 2.11 along with the
  existing Spark 1.6 JAR compiled with Scala 2.10.

* The Java client now allows configuring scanners to read from the closest replica instead of
  the known leader replica. The default remains the latter. Use the relevant `ReplicaSelection`
  enum with the scanner's builder to change this behavior.

* Tablet servers use a new policy for retaining write-ahead log (WAL) segments.
  Previously, servers used the 'log_min_segments_to_retain' flag to prioritize
  any flushes which were retaining log segments past the configured value (default 2).
  This policy caused servers to flush in-memory data more frequently than necessary,
  limiting write performance.
+
The new policy introduces a new flag 'log_target_replay_size_mb' which
  determines the threshold at which write-ahead log retention will prioritize flushes.
  The new flag is considered experimental and users should not need to modify
  its value.
+
The improved policy has been seen to improve write performance in some use cases
  by a factor of 2x relative to the old policy.

* Kudu's implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm has been improved to include
  a "pre-election" phase. This can improve the stability of tablet leader election
  in high-load scenarios, especially if each server hosts a high number of tablets.

* Tablet server start-up time has been substantially improved in the case that
  the server contains a high number of tombstoned tablet replicas.

=== Command line tools

* The tool `kudu tablet leader_step_down` has been added to manually force a leader to step down.
* The tool `kudu remote_replica copy` has been added to manually copy a replica from
  one running tablet server to another.
* The tool `kudu local_replica delete` has been added to delete a replica of a tablet.
* The `kudu test loadgen` tool has been added to replace the obsoleted
  `insert-generated-rows` standalone binary. The new tool is enriched with
  additional functionality and can be used to run load generation tests against
  a Kudu cluster.

== Wire protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.1.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.1 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0. If the client uses the new
  'IN LIST' predicate type, an error will be returned.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.1 without limitations.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.0 and Kudu 1.1 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.

[[rn_1.1.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible changes in Kudu 1.1.0

=== Client APIs ({cpp}/Java/Python)

* The {cpp} client no longer requires the
  link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html[old gcc5 ABI].
  Which ABI is actually used depends on the compiler configuration. Some new distros
  (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04) will use the new ABI. Your application must use the same ABI as is
  used by the client library; an easy way to guarantee this is to use the same compiler
  to build both.

* The {cpp} client's `KuduSession::CountBufferedOperations()` method is
  deprecated. Its behavior is inconsistent unless the session runs in the
  `MANUAL_FLUSH` mode. Instead, to get number of buffered operations, count
  invocations of the `KuduSession::Apply()` method since last
  `KuduSession::Flush()` call or, if using asynchronous flushing, since last
  invocation of the callback passed into `KuduSession::FlushAsync()`.

* The Java client's `OperationResponse.getWriteTimestamp` method was renamed to `getWriteTimestampRaw`
  to emphasize that it doesn't return milliseconds, unlike what its Javadoc indicated. The renamed
  method was also hidden from the public APIs and should not be used.

* The Java client's sync API (`KuduClient`, `KuduSession`, `KuduScanner`) used to throw either
  a `NonRecoverableException` or a `TimeoutException` for a timeout, and now it's only possible for the
  client to throw the former.

* The Java client's handling of errors in `KuduSession` was modified so that subclasses of
  `KuduException` are converted into RowErrors instead of being thrown.

[[rn_1.0.1]]
== Release notes specific to 1.0.1

Apache Kudu 1.0.1 is a bug fix release, with no new features or backwards
incompatible changes.

[[rn_1.0.1_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1681[KUDU-1681] Fixed a bug in
  the tablet server which could cause a crash when the DNS lookup during master
  heartbeat failed.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1660[KUDU-1660]: Fixed a bug
  which would cause the Kudu master and tablet server to fail to start on single
  CPU systems.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1651[KUDU-1652]: Fixed a bug
  that would cause the C++ client, tablet server, and Java client to crash or
  throw an exception when attempting to scan a table with a predicate which
  simplifies to `IS NOT NULL` on a non-nullable column. For instance, setting a
  `<= 127` predicate on an `INT8` column could trigger this bug, since the
  predicate only filters null values.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1651[KUDU-1651]: Fixed a bug
  that would cause the tablet server to crash when evaluating a scan with
  predicates over a dictionary encoded column containing an entire block of null
  values.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1623[KUDU-1623]: Fixed a bug
  that would cause the tablet server to crash when handling UPSERT operations
  that only set values for the primary key columns.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/4488[Gerrit #4488] Fixed a bug in the
  Java client's KuduException class which could cause an unexpected
  NullPointerException to be thrown when the exception did not have an
  associated message.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1090[KUDU-1090] Fixed a bug in
  the memory tracker which could cause a rare crash during tablet server
  startup.

[[rn_1.0.0]]
== Release notes specific to 1.0.0

After approximately a year of beta releases, Apache Kudu has reached version 1.0.
This version number signifies that the development team feels that Kudu is stable
enough for usage in production environments.

If you are new to Kudu, check out its list of link:index.html[features and benefits].

[[rn_1.0.0_new_features]]
=== New features

Kudu 1.0.0 delivers a number of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations.

- Removal of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) history is now supported.
  This is known as tablet history GC. This allows Kudu to reclaim disk space,
  where previously Kudu would keep a full history of all changes made to a
  given table since the beginning of time. Previously, the only way to reclaim
  disk space was to drop a table.
+
Kudu will still keep historical data, and the amount of history retained is
  controlled by setting the configuration flag `--tablet_history_max_age_sec`,
  which defaults to 15 minutes (expressed in seconds). The timestamp
  represented by the current time minus `tablet_history_max_age_sec` is known
  as the ancient history mark (AHM). When a compaction or flush occurs, Kudu
  will remove the history of changes made prior to the ancient history mark.
  This only affects historical data; currently-visible data will not be
  removed. A specialized maintenance manager background task to remove existing
  "cold" historical data that is not in a row affected by the normal compaction
  process will be added in a future release.

- Most of Kudu's command line tools have been consolidated under a new
  top-level `kudu` tool. This reduces the number of large binaries distributed
  with Kudu and also includes much-improved help output.

- The Kudu Flume Sink now supports processing events containing Avro-encoded
  records, using the new `AvroKuduOperationsProducer`.

- Administrative tools including `kudu cluster ksck` now support running
  against multi-master Kudu clusters.

- The output of the `ksck` tool is now colorized and much easier to read.

- The {cpp} client API now supports writing data in `AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND` mode.
  This can provide higher throughput for ingest workloads.

=== Optimizations and improvements

- The performance of comparison predicates on dictionary-encoded columns has
  been substantially optimized. Users are encouraged to use dictionary encoding
  on any string or binary columns with low cardinality, especially if these
  columns will be filtered with predicates.

- The Java client is now able to prune partitions from scanners based on the
  provided predicates. For example, an equality predicate on a hash-partitioned
  column will now only access those tablets that could possibly contain matching
  data. This is expected to improve performance for the Spark integration as well
  as applications using the Java client API.

- The performance of compaction selection in the tablet server has been
  substantially improved. This can increase the efficiency of the background
  maintenance threads and improve overall throughput of heavy write workloads.

- The policy by which the tablet server retains write-ahead log (WAL) files has
  been improved so that it takes into account other replicas of the tablet.
  This should help mitigate the spurious eviction of tablet replicas on machines
  that temporarily lag behind the other replicas.

=== Wire protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.0.0 maintains client-server wire-compatibility with previous releases.
Applications using the Kudu client libraries may be upgraded either
before, at the same time, or after the Kudu servers.

Kudu 1.0.0 does _not_ maintain server-server wire compatibility with previous
releases. Therefore, rolling upgrades between earlier versions of Kudu and
Kudu 1.0.0 are not supported.

[[rn_1.0.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes in Kudu 1.0.0

==== Command line tools

- The `kudu-pbc-dump` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented as `kudu pbc dump`.

- The `kudu-ksck` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented as `kudu cluster ksck`.

- The `cfile-dump` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented as `kudu fs cfile dump`.

- The `log-dump` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented as `kudu wal dump` and `kudu local_replica dump wals`.

- The `kudu-admin` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented within `kudu table` and `kudu tablet`.

- The `kudu-fs_dump` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented as `kudu fs dump`.

- The `kudu-ts-cli` tool has been removed. The same functionality is now
  implemented within `kudu master`, `kudu remote_replica`, and `kudu tserver`.

- The `kudu-fs_list` tool has been removed and some similar useful
  functionality has been moved under 'kudu local_replica'.

==== Configuration flags

- Some configuration flags are now marked as 'unsafe' and 'experimental'. Such flags
  are disallowed by default. Users may access these flags by enabling the additional
  flags `--unlock_unsafe_flags` and `--unlock_experimental_flags`. Usage of such flags
  is not recommended, as the flags may be removed or modified with no deprecation period
  and without notice in future Kudu releases.

==== Client APIs ({cpp}/Java/Python)

- The `TIMESTAMP` column type has been renamed to `UNIXTIME_MICROS` in order to
  reduce confusion between Kudu's timestamp support and the timestamps supported
  by other systems such as Apache Hive and Apache Impala (incubating). Existing
  tables will automatically be updated to use the new name for the type.
+
Clients upgrading to the new client libraries must move to the new name for
  the type.  Clients using old client libraries will continue to operate using
  the old type name, even when connected to clusters that have been
  upgraded. Similarly, if clients are upgraded before servers, existing
  timestamp columns will be available using the new type name.


- `KuduSession` methods in the {cpp} library are no longer advertised as thread-safe
  to have one set of semantics for both {cpp} and Java Kudu client libraries.

- The `KuduScanToken::TabletServers` method in the {cpp} library has been removed.
  The same information can now be found in the KuduScanToken::tablet method.

==== Apache Flume Integration

- The `KuduEventProducer` interface used to process Flume events into Kudu operations
  for the Kudu Flume Sink has changed, and has been renamed `KuduOperationsProducer`.
  The existing `KuduEventProducer`s have been updated for the new interface, and have
  been renamed similarly.

[[rn_0.10.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.10.0

Kudu 0.10.0 delivers a number of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations,
detailed below.

Kudu 0.10.0 maintains wire-compatibility with previous releases, meaning
that applications using the Kudu client libraries may be upgraded either
before, at the same time, or after the Kudu servers. However, if you begin
using new features of Kudu 0.10.0 such as manually range-partitioned tables,
you must first upgrade all clients to this release.

This release does not maintain full Java API or ABI compatibility with
Kudu 0.9.x due to a package rename and some other small changes. See below for details.

changes between 0.9.1 and 0.10.0</a>+++.

To upgrade to Kudu 0.10.0, see <<rn_0.10.0_upgrade>>.

[[rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes and deprecated APIs in 0.10.0

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3737[Gerrit #3737] The Java client has been repackaged
  under `org.apache.kudu` instead of `org.kududb`. Import statements for Kudu classes must
  be modified in order to compile against 0.10.0. Wire compatibility is maintained.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3055/[Gerrit #3055] The Java client's
  synchronous API methods now throw `KuduException` instead of `Exception`.
  Existing code that catches `Exception` should still compile, but introspection of an
  exception's message may be impacted. This change was made to allow thrown exceptions to be
  queried more easily using `KuduException.getStatus` and calling one of `Status`'s methods.
  For example, an operation that tries to delete a table that doesn't exist would return a
  `Status` that returns true when queried on `isNotFound()`.

- The Java client's `KuduTable.getTabletsLocations` set of methods is now
  deprecated. Additionally, they now take an exclusive end partition key instead
  of an inclusive key. Applications are encouraged to use the scan tokens API
  instead of these methods in the future.

- The C++ API for specifying split points on range-partitioned tables has been improved
  to make it easier for callers to properly manage the ownership of the provided rows.
+
The `TableCreator::split_rows` API took a `vector<const KuduPartialRow*>`, which
  made it very difficult for the calling application to do proper error handling with
  cleanup when setting the fields of the `KuduPartialRow`. This API has been now been
  deprecated and replaced by a new method `TableCreator::add_range_split` which allows
  easier use of smart pointers for safe memory management.

- The Java client's internal buffering has been reworked. Previously, the number of
  buffered write operations was constrained on a per-tablet-server basis. Now, the configured
  maximum buffer size constrains the total number of buffered operations across all
  tablet servers in the cluster. This provides a more consistent bound on the memory
  usage of the client regardless of the size of the cluster to which it is writing.
+
This change can negatively affect the write performance of Java clients which rely on
  buffered writes. Consider using the `setMutationBufferSpace` API to increase a
  session's maximum buffer size if write performance seems to be degraded after upgrading
  to Kudu 0.10.0.

- The "remote bootstrap" process used to copy a tablet replica from one host to
  another has been renamed to "Tablet Copy". This resulted in the renaming of
  several RPC metrics. Any users previously explicitly fetching or monitoring metrics
  related to Remote Bootstrap should update their scripts to reflect the new names.

- The SparkSQL datasource for Kudu no longer supports mode `Overwrite`. Users should
  use the new `KuduContext.upsertRows` method instead. Additionally, inserts using the
  datasource are now upserts by default. The older behavior can be restored by setting
  the `operation` parameter to `insert`.

[[rn_0.10.0_new_features]]
=== New features

- Users may now manually manage the partitioning of a range-partitioned table.
  When a table is created, the user may specify a set of range partitions that
  do not cover the entire available key space. A user may add or drop range
  partitions to existing tables.
+
This feature can be particularly helpful with time series workloads in which
  new partitions can be created on an hourly or daily basis. Old partitions
  may be efficiently dropped if the application does not need to retain historical
  data past a certain point.
+
This feature is considered experimental for the 0.10 release. More details of
  the new feature can be found in the accompanying
  link:https://kudu.apache.org/2016/08/23/new-range-partitioning-features.html[blog post].

- Support for running Kudu clusters with multiple masters has been stabilized.
  Users may start a cluster with three or five masters to provide fault tolerance
  despite a failure of one or two masters, respectively.
+
Note that certain tools (e.g. `ksck`) are still lacking complete support for
  multiple masters. These deficiencies will be addressed in a following release.

- Kudu now supports the ability to reserve a certain amount of free disk space
  in each of its configured data directories. If a directory's free disk space
  drops to less than the configured minimum, Kudu will stop writing to that
  directory until space becomes available. If no space is available in any
  configured directory, Kudu will abort.
+
This feature may be configured using the `fs_data_dirs_reserved_bytes` and
  `fs_wal_dir_reserved_bytes` flags.

- The Spark integration's `KuduContext` now supports four new methods for writing to
  Kudu tables: `insertRows`, `upsertRows`, `updateRows`, and `deleteRows`. These are
  now the preferred way to write to Kudu tables from Spark.

[[rn_0.10.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements and optimizations

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1516[KUDU-1516] The `kudu-ksck` tool
  has been improved and now detects problems such as when a tablet does not have
  a majority of replicas on live tablet servers, or if those replicas aren’t in a
  good state. Users who currently depend on the tool to detect inconsistencies may now see
  failures when before they wouldn't see any.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3477[Gerrit #3477] The way operations are buffered in
  the Java client has been reworked. Previously, the session's buffer size was set per tablet, meaning that a buffer
  size of 1,000 for 10 tablets being written to allowed for 10,000 operations to be buffered at the
  same time. With this change, all the tablets share one buffer, so users might need to set a
  bigger buffer size in order to reach the same level of performance as before.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3674/[Gerrit #3674] Added LESS and GREATER options for
  column predicates.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1444[KUDU-1444] added support for passing
  back basic per-scan metrics (e.g cache hit rate) from the server to the C++ client. See the
  `KuduScanner::GetResourceMetrics()` API for detailed usage. This feature will be supported
  in the Java client API in a future release.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1446[KUDU-1446] improved the order in
  which the tablet server evaluates predicates, so that predicates on smaller columns
  are evaluated first. This may improve performance on queries which apply predicates
  on multiple columns of different sizes.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1398[KUDU-1398] improved the storage
  efficiency of Kudu's internal primary key indexes. This optimization should decrease space
  usage and improve random access performance, particularly for workloads with lengthy
  primary keys.

[[rn_0.10.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/[Gerrit #3541] Fixed a problem in the Java client
  whereby an RPC could be dropped when a connection to a tablet server or master was forcefully
  closed on the server-side while RPCs to that server were in the process of being encoded.
  The effect was that the RPC would not be sent, and users of the synchronous API would receive
  a `TimeoutException`. Several other Java client bugs which could cause similar spurious timeouts
  were also fixed in this release.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3724/[Gerrit #3724] Fixed a problem in the Java client
  whereby an RPC could be dropped when a socket timeout was fired while that RPC was being sent to
  a tablet server or master. This would manifest itself in the same way
  link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/[Gerrit #3541].

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1538[KUDU-1538] fixed a bug in which recycled
  block identifiers could cause the tablet server to lose data. Following this bug fix, block
  identifiers will no longer be reused.

[[rn_0.10.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

- This is the first release of Apache Kudu as a top-level (non-incubating)
  project!

- The default false positive rate for Bloom filters has been changed
  from 1% to 0.01%. This will increase the space consumption of Bloom
  filters by a factor of two (from approximately 10 bits per row to
  approximately 20 bits per row). This is expected to substantially
  improve the performance of random-write workloads at the cost of an
  incremental increase in disk space usage.

- The Kudu C++ client library now has Doxygen-based
  link:http://kudu.apache.org/cpp-client-api/[API documentation]
  available online.

- Kudu now
  link:http://kudu.apache.org/2016/06/17/raft-consensus-single-node.html[
  uses the Raft consensus algorithm even for unreplicated tables].
  This change simplifies code and will also allow administrators to enable
  replication on a previously-unreplicated table. This change is internal and
  should not be visible to users.

[[rn_0.9.1]]
== Release notes specific to 0.9.1

Kudu 0.9.1 delivers incremental bug fixes over Kudu 0.9.0. It is fully compatible with
Kudu 0.9.0.

[[rn_0.9.1_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1469[KUDU-1469] fixed a bug in
our Raft consensus implementation that could cause a tablet to stop making progress after a leader
election.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3456/[Gerrit #3456] fixed a bug in which

To upgrade to Kudu 0.10.0, see <<rn_0.9.0_upgrade>>.

[[rn_0.9.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes

- The `KuduTableInputFormat` command has changed the way in which it handles
  scan predicates, including how it serializes predicates to the job configuration
  object. The new configuration key is `kudu.mapreduce.encoded.predicate`. Clients
  using the `TableInputFormatConfigurator` are not affected.

- The `kudu-spark` sub-project has been renamed to follow naming conventions for
  Scala. The new name is `kudu-spark_2.10`.

- Default table partitioning has been removed. All tables must now be created
  with explicit partitioning. Existing tables are unaffected. See the
  link:schema_design.html#no_default_partitioning[schema design guide] for more
  details.

[[rn_0.9.0_new_features]]
=== New features
- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1002[KUDU-1002] Added support for
 `UPSERT` operations, whereby a row is inserted if it does not already exist, but
 updated if it does. Support for `UPSERT` is included in Java, C++, and Python APIs,
 but not in Impala.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1306[KUDU-1306] Scan token API
  for creating partition-aware scan descriptors. This API simplifies executing
  parallel scans for clients and query engines.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2848/[Gerrit 2848] Added a kudu datasource
  for Spark. This datasource uses the Kudu client directly instead of
  using the MapReduce API. Predicate pushdowns for `spark-sql` and Spark filters are
  included, as well as parallel retrieval for multiple tablets and column projections.
  See an example of link:developing.html#_kudu_integration_with_spark[Kudu integration with Spark].

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2992/[Gerrit 2992] Added the ability
  to update and insert from Spark using a Kudu datasource.

[[rn_0.9.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1415[KUDU-1415] Added statistics in the Java
  client such as the number of bytes written and the number of operations applied.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1451[KUDU-1451] Improved tablet server restart
  time when the tablet server needs to clean up of a lot previously deleted tablets. Tablets are
  now cleaned up after they are deleted.

[[rn_0.9.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-678[KUDU-678] Fixed a leak that happened during
  DiskRowSet compactions where tiny blocks were still written to disk even if there were no REDO
  records. With the default block manager, it usually resulted in block containers with thousands
  of tiny blocks.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1437[KUDU-1437] Fixed a data corruption issue
  that occured after compacting sequences of negative INT32 values in a column that
  was configured with RLE encoding.

[[rn_0.9.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

All Kudu clients have longer default timeout values, as listed below.

.Java
- The default operation timeout and the default admin operation timeout
  are now set to 30 seconds instead of 10.
- The default socket read timeout is now 10 seconds instead of 5.

.C++
- The default admin timeout is now 30 seconds instead of 10.
- The default RPC timeout is now 10 seconds instead of 5.
- The default scan timeout is now 30 seconds instead of 15.

- Some default settings related to I/O behavior during flushes and compactions have been changed:
  The default for `flush_threshold_mb` has been increased from 64MB to 1000MB. The default
  `cfile_do_on_finish` has been changed from `close` to `flush`.
  link:http://getkudu.io/2016/04/26/ycsb.html[Experiments using YCSB] indicate that these
  values will provide better throughput for write-heavy applications on typical server hardware.


[[rn_0.8.0]]

changes between 0.7.1 and 0.8.0</a>+++.

To upgrade to Kudu 0.8.0, see link:installation.html#upgrade[Upgrade from 0.7.1 to 0.8.0].

[[rn_0.8.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes

- 0.8.0 clients are not fully compatible with servers running Kudu 0.7.1 or lower.
In particular, scans that specify column predicates will fail. To work around this
issue, upgrade all Kudu servers before upgrading clients.

[[rn_0.8.0_new_features]]
=== New features

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-431[KUDU-431] A simple Flume
  sink has been implemented.

[[rn_0.8.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-839[KUDU-839] Java RowError now uses an enum error code.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2138/[Gerrit 2138] The handling of
  column predicates has been re-implemented in the server and clients.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1379[KUDU-1379] Partition pruning
  has been implemented for C++ clients (but not yet for the Java client). This feature
  allows you to avoid reading a tablet if you know it does not serve the row keys you are querying.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2641[Gerrit 2641] Kudu now uses
  `earliest-deadline-first` RPC scheduling and rejection. This changes the behavior
  of the RPC service queue to prevent unfairness when processing a backlog of RPC
  threads and to increase the likelihood that an RPC will be processed before it
  can time out.


[[rn_0.8.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1337[KUDU-1337] Tablets from tables
  that were deleted might be unnecessarily re-bootstrapped when the leader gets the
  notification to delete itself after the replicas do.

- link:https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-969[KUDU-969] If a tablet server
  shuts down while compacting a rowset and receiving updates for it, it might immediately
  crash upon restart while bootstrapping that rowset's tablet.

- link:https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1354[KUDU-1354] Due to a bug in Kudu's
  MVCC implementation where row locks were released before the MVCC commit happened,
  flushed data would include out-of-order transactions, triggering a crash on the
  next compaction.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1322[KUDU-1322] The C++ client
  now retries write operations if the tablet it is trying to reach has already been
  deleted.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2571/[Gerrit 2571] Due to a bug in the
  Java client, users were unable to close the `kudu-spark` shell because of
  lingering non-daemon threads.

[[rn_0.8.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2239/[Gerrit 2239] The concept of "feature flags"
  was introduced in order to manage compatibility between different
  Kudu versions. One case where this is helpful is if a newer client attempts to use
  a feature unsupported by the currently-running tablet server. Rather than receiving
  a cryptic error, the user gets an error message that is easier to interpret.
  This is an internal change for Kudu system developers and requires no action by
  users of the clients or API.

[[rn_0.7.1]]
== Release notes specific to 0.7.1

Kudu 0.7.1 is a bug fix release for 0.7.0.

[[rn_0.7.1_fixed_issues]]

=== Fixed Issues

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1325[KUDU-1325] fixes a tablet server crash that could
occur during table deletion. In some cases, while a table was being deleted, other replicas would
attempt to re-replicate tablets to servers that had already processed the deletion. This could
trigger a race condition that caused a crash.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1341[KUDU-1341] fixes a potential data corruption and
crash that could happen shortly after tablet server restarts in workloads that repeatedly delete
and re-insert rows with the same primary key. In most cases, this corruption affected only a single
replica and could be repaired by re-replicating from another.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1343[KUDU-1343] fixes a bug in the Java client that
occurs when a scanner has to scan multiple batches from one tablet and then start scanning from
another. In particular, this would affect any scans using the Java client that read large numbers
of rows from multi-tablet tables.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1345[KUDU-1345] fixes a bug where in some cases the
hybrid clock could jump backwards, resulting in a crash followed by an inability to
restart the affected tablet server.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1360[KUDU-1360] fixes a bug in the kudu-spark module
which prevented reading rows with `NULL` values.

[[rn_0.7.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.7.0

Kudu 0.7.0 is the first release done as part of the Apache Incubator and includes a number
of changes, new features, improvements, and fixes.

changes between 0.6.0 and 0.7.0</a>+++.

The upgrade instructions can be found at link:installation.html#upgrade[Upgrade from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0].

[[rn_0.7.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes

- The C++ client includes a new API, `KuduScanBatch`, which performs better when a
large number of small rows are returned in a batch. The old API of `vector<KuduRowResult>`
is deprecated.
+
NOTE: This change is API-compatible but *not* ABI-compatible.

- The default replication factor has been changed from 1 to 3. Existing tables will
continue to use the replication factor they were created with. Applications that create
tables may not work properly if they assume a replication factor of 1 and fewer than
3 replicas are available. To use the previous default replication factor, start the
master with the configuration flag `--default_num_replicas=1`.

- The Python client has been completely rewritten, with a focus on improving code
quality and testing. The read path (scanners) has been improved by adding many of
the features already supported by the C++ and Java clients. The Python client is no
longer considered experimental.

[[rn_0.7.0_new_features]]
=== New features

- With the goal of Spark integration in mind, a new `kuduRDD` API has been added,
which wraps `newAPIHadoopRDD` and includes a default source for Spark SQL.

[[rn_0.7.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements

- The Java client includes new methods `countPendingErrors()` and
`getPendingErrors()` on `KuduSession`. These methods allow you to count and
retrieve outstanding row errors when configuring sessions with `AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND`.

- New server-level metrics allow you to monitor CPU usage and context switching.

- Kudu now builds on RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SLES 12. Extra instructions are included
for SLES 12.


[[rn_0.7.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1288[KUDU-1288] fixes a severe file descriptor
leak, which could previously only be resolved by restarting the tablet server.

- https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1250[KUDU-1250] fixes a hang in the Java
client when processing an in-flight batch and the previous batch encountered an error.

[[rn_0.7.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

- The file block manager's performance was improved, but it is still not recommended for
real-world use.

- The master now attempts to spread tablets more evenly across the cluster during
table creation. This has no impact on existing tables, but will improve the speed
at which under-replicated tablets are re-replicated after a tablet server failure.

- All licensing documents have been modified to adhere to ASF guidelines.

- Kudu now requires an out-of-tree build directory. Review the build instructions
for additional information.

- The `C++` client library is now explicitly built against the
link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html[old gcc5 ABI].
If you use gcc5 to build a Kudu application, your application must use the old ABI
as well. This is typically achieved by defining the `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` macro
at compile-time when building your application. For more information, see the
previous link and link:http://developerblog.redhat.com/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/.

- The Python client is no longer considered experimental.


[[rn_0.6.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.6.0

The 0.6.0 release contains incremental improvements and bug fixes. The most notable
changes are:

- The Java client's CreateTableBuilder and AlterTableBuilder classes have been renamed
to CreateTableOptions and AlterTableOptions. Their methods now also return `this` objects,
allowing them to be used as builders.
- The Java client's AbstractKuduScannerBuilder#maxNumBytes() setter is now called
batchSizeBytes as is the corresponding property in AsyncKuduScanner. This makes it
consistent with the C++ client.
- The "kudu-admin" tool can now list and delete tables via its new subcommands
"list_tables" and "delete_table <table_name>".
- OSX is now supported for single-host development. Please consult its specific installation
instructions in link:installation.html#osx_from_source[OS X].


[[rn_0.5.0]]
== Release Notes Specific to 0.5.0

Kudu 0.5.0 was the first public release. As such, no improvements or changes were
noted in its release notes.
