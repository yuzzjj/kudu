== Schema and Usage Limitations
* Kudu is primarily designed for analytic use cases. You are likely to encounter issues if
  a single row contains multiple kilobytes of data.

* The columns which make up the primary key must be listed first in the schema.

* The primary key may not be changed after the table is created.
  You must drop and recreate a table to select a new primary key.

* The primary key of a row may not be modified using the `UPDATE` functionality.
  To modify a row's primary key, the row must be deleted and re-inserted with
  the modified key. Such a modification is non-atomic.

* Columns with `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, or `BOOL` types are not allowed as part of a
  primary key definition. Additionally, all columns that are part of a primary
  key definition must be `NOT NULL`.

* Type and nullability of existing columns cannot be changed by altering the table.

* Dropping a column does not immediately reclaim space. Compaction must run first.
There is no way to run compaction manually, but dropping the table will reclaim the
space immediately.

== Partitioning Limitations
* Tables must be manually pre-split into tablets using simple or compound primary
  keys. Automatic splitting is not yet possible. Range partitions may be added
  or dropped after a table has been created. See
  link:schema_design.html[Schema Design] for more information.

* Data in existing tables cannot currently be automatically repartitioned. As a workaround,
  create a new table with the new partitioning and insert the contents of the old
  table.

== Replication and Backup Limitations
* Kudu does not currently include any built-in features for backup and restore.
  Users are encouraged to use tools such as Spark or Impala to export or import
  tables as necessary.

== Impala Limitations

* Updates, inserts, and deletes via Impala are non-transactional. If a query
  fails part of the way through, its partial effects will not be rolled back.

* No timestamp and decimal type support.

* The maximum parallelism of a single query is limited to the number of tablets
  in a table. For good analytic performance, aim for 10 or more tablets per host
  or use large tables.

== Security Limitations

* Authorization is only available at a system-wide, coarse-grained level. Table-level,
  column-level, and row-level authorization features are not available.

* Data encryption at rest is not built in. Kudu has been reported to run correctly
  on systems using local block device encryption (e.g. `dmcrypt`).

* Kudu server Kerberos principals must follow the pattern `kudu/<HOST>@DEFAULT.REALM`.
  Configuring an alternate Kerberos principal is not supported.

* Kudu's integration with Apache Flume does not support writing to Kudu clusters that
  require Kerberos authentication.

* Kudu client instances retrieve authentication tokens upon first contact with the
  cluster. These tokens expire after one week. Use of a single Kudu client instance
  for more than one week is not supported.

== Other Known Issues

The following are known bugs and issues with the current release of Kudu. They will
be addressed in later releases. Note that this list is not exhaustive, and is meant
to communicate only the most important known issues.

* If the Kudu master is configured with the `-log_force_fsync_all` option, tablet servers
  and clients will experience frequent timeouts, and the cluster may become unusable.

* If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes
  to start up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 100 or fewer.
  Consider this limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times,
  you can monitor the number of tablets per server in the web UI.
